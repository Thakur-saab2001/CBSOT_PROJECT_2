# 🔎 AI Research Paper Intelligence System

An AI-powered research paper discovery system that uses **Semantic Search** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to find relevant Machine Learning research papers based on the meaning of a user's query instead of exact keyword matching.

The project demonstrates how transformer-based embeddings and vector similarity search can improve information retrieval from large collections of research papers.

---

## 📌 Overview

Searching research papers using traditional keyword search often misses relevant publications because different authors use different terminology.

This project addresses that challenge by converting research paper abstracts into dense vector embeddings and retrieving the most semantically similar papers using FAISS. To further improve usability, the retrieved papers are summarized automatically and their important topics are extracted.
