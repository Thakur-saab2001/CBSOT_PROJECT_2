# 🔎 AI Research Paper Intelligence System (Semantic Search & NLP Based)

An AI-powered research paper discovery system that uses **Semantic Search** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to find relevant Machine Learning research papers based on the meaning of a user's query instead of exact keyword matching.

The project demonstrates how transformer-based embeddings and vector similarity search can improve information retrieval from large collections of research papers.

---

## 📌 Overview

Searching research papers using traditional keyword search often misses relevant publications because different authors use different terminology.

This project addresses that challenge by converting research paper abstracts into dense vector embeddings and retrieving the most semantically similar papers using FAISS. To further improve usability, the retrieved papers are summarized automatically and their important topics are extracted.

- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- 🤖 Generate semantic embeddings using Sentence Transformers
- ⚡ Fast similarity search using FAISS
- 📝 Automatic abstract summarization
- 🔑 Keyword extraction using KeyBERT
- 📊 Interactive search workflow in Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **ML ArXiv Papers** dataset available through Hugging Face.

**Source**

https://huggingface.co/datasets/CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers

### Dataset Information

- Research papers from arXiv
- Machine Learning domain
- Paper title
- Abstract
- Metadata

The notebooks load the dataset directly using the Hugging Face `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers")
```

For computational efficiency, the project processes the first **50,000 papers** to generate sentence embeddings and build the FAISS index.
